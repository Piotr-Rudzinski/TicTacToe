# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game - result identification added

## What was done

A method, that *checks* the result of the game, was added. It concatenates chars in:

-rows
-columns
-diagonals

(one by one) and compares it with a pattern.

##Another solution

Sum an ASCII representation of chars in row, column, diagonally and copare it with a pattern
